# [Funkin' Fanmasters](https://github.com/Yoshubs/FunkinForever)
Built off of an open-source, modular, optimized, and HOPEFULLY easy to use [Friday Night Funkin'](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/770371) mod engine!
----------------------------------------------

Info
----------------------------------------------
This is a collection of fanmade remasters (in the form of re-sprites, and in the rare instances, code and music) that I've made, but put on Forever Engine. That doesn't mean the fanmasters are better than the originals however, this is only a tribute to Friday Night Funkin' and its modding community, a small project of mine that I hope people can find enjoyment and use out of!

**FOREVER ENGINE IS ONLY MEANT TO BE USED ON DESKTOP! BIG L MOMENTO!**

----------------------------------------------
Forever Engine's FEATURES! - 

Noteskins,
Custom UIs,
Options Menu with FPS Capping and adjustments
A lot of modularity and freedom with options (hopefully in the future EVERYTHING will be toggleable)
A restructure and partial remake of the base game's source code
Source Code folder abstraction
More streamlined code (only having to set things in one place)
AND MORE!

ORIGINAL FOREVER ENGINE CREDITS:
----------------------------------------------
I don't care how big this section gets over time, I will actually keep expanding it. People deserve credit for what they do!

[Yoshubs](https://github.com/Yoshubs) - made the engine. she just so happens to be very fucking stupid for accidentally pushing the martian mixtape source code into forever engine's base github page

[Pixloen](https://github.com/PixlJacket) - made a lot of the custom assets that forever engine uses, he also gave me a lot of general advice on how to improve the engine as well as his input on both how to improve upon the base game and how the input system felt and such. ALSO PROGRAMMED SIMPLY JUDGEMENTS AND BACKGROUND DARKEN, He basically co-owns the engine lmao

[Gedehari](https://github.com/gedehari) - BANGER ASS PROGRAMMER, made the freeplay loading thread to avoid lag issues in freeplay, waveform render code (which will be used soon), freaking EXTERNAL SHADER SUPPORT for modcharts when they're a thing and so many other things like the crashlogger. I urge you to check out his project, [Izzy Engine](https://github.com/gedehari/IzzyEngine), which he let me borrow a lot of aspects from which I still owe him for lmao. AWESOME dude I can't stress this enough

[ImCodist](https://github.com/ImCodist) - helped with a couple of pull requests and issue fixes, ALSO MADE THE WHOLE ASS FREAKING DIALOGUE SYSTEM, but, I'm not gonna give him any credit at all, because he stole my obsidian soul in minecraft and I will never forgive him for that!!!!

[Scarlett](https://github.com/SomeKitten) - Overall cool friend of mine who knows a lot about programming and math that has helped me out countless times, still going here helping me with pushes, commits, etc. She wrote the finalised math formula for the note quants and fixed the song name issue.

[Oneilr](https://oneilr.newgrounds.com/) - Cool Guy Oneilr, made some of the custom assets, mostly the animated ones like the custom note splashes to avoid the week 7 embargo as well as some other things like the checkmarks in the options menu.

[HelloSammu](https://github.com/hellosammu) - weird catgirl programmer, they scare me
CREDITED MAINTENANCE AND SOME MISC FIXES, also scaleable text for dialogue functions

[ninjamuffin99](https://ninjamuffin99.newgrounds.com/) - HE MADE THE BASE GAME SO LIKE WITHOUT HIM THIS WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE GO CHECK HIM OUT RIGHT NOW

rest of the rise n' skate team - that mod is the reason im even making an engine right now so like I kind of owe you guys this whole engine and more for that honestly and I will actually do more so stay tuned

[j](https://github.com/j) - Jordan Stout is real!!!

How to Compile:

Basically, all of the files you need are in the engine itself through the setup.bat (Huge thanks to [FNF Source Code Guide](https://gamebanana.com/tuts/13798) for the download to the file) except for Visual Studio Code, or whatever program you choose to use to program in the engine. If you've already worked with fnf, this should work perfectly with you and if it doesn't then you might have the wrong target settings, or Lime is probably broken, that's usually what happens with these things, it's happened to me a ton of times lmao. I'm not a very good programmer.
If you want some external sources that will better walk you through how to compile the game, look no further than the [base game github](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin) and [FNF Source Code Guide](https://gamebanana.com/tuts/13798), I really hope they help you out!
