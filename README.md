Built off of an open-source, modular, optimized, and HOPEFULLY easy to use [Friday Night Funkin'](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/770371) mod engine!

> Made with Newgrounds love and passion to mind, Friday Night Funkin' is a 4-key rhythm game originally made for the Ludum Dare game jam. Over the years, Newgrounds has been a to-go site for many people, especially in the early 2000's, mainly to play flash games or animations. Friday Night Funkin' pays tribute to that by trying to look a bit like a flash animation in the form of a video game, with the line, "Cartoon Rhythm Gaming Excellence." 
> Shoutouts to Tom Fulp, how much do I need to say it?

Quick Notes!
----------------------------------------------
This is a collection of fanmade remasters (in the form of re-sprites, and in the rare instances, code and music) that I've made based off of other people's modifications of Friday Night Funkin', but put on Forever Engine, another Friday Night Funkin'. That doesn't mean the fanmasters are better than the originals however, this is only a tribute to Friday Night Funkin' and its modding community, a small project of mine that I hope people can find enjoyment and use out of!


For those who are new to Friday Night Funkin' and its modding scene, Forever Engine is a rewrite of the game intended for ease of access, which includes things such as a redone options menu, colorblind filters, noteskins, and more!

**FOREVER ENGINE IS ONLY MEANT TO BE USED ON DESKTOP! BIG L MOMENTO!**

How to Compile:
----------------------------------------------

Basically, all of the files you need are in the engine itself through the setup.bat (Huge thanks to [FNF Source Code Guide](https://gamebanana.com/tuts/13798) for the download to the file) except for Visual Studio Code, or whatever program you choose to use to program in the engine. If you've already worked with FNF', this should work perfectly with you and if it doesn't, then you might have the wrong target settings, or Lime is probably broken, that's usually what happens with these things. It's happened to me a ton of times, I'm not a good programmer.

When you finish with that, put the following in the terminal:
```
haxelib install flixel-screenshot-plugin
```
This is so that the game can take screenshots by pressing F2.

If you want some external sources that will better walk you through how to compile the game, look no further than the [base game github](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin) and [FNF Source Code Guide](https://gamebanana.com/tuts/13798), I really hope they help you out!
